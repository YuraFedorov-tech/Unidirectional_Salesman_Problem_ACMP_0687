# Unidirectional_Salesman_Problem_ACMP_0687

An m Ã— n matrix of integers is given. The path begins on any row of the first column and consists of a sequence of steps that break off in column n. Each step consists of a transition from column i to column i + 1 to the adjacent (horizontal or diagonal) cell. The weight of the path is the sum of the integers recorded in each of the n visited cells.

It is required to write a program that calculates the path with the minimum weight from the left edge of the matrix to the right.
